                    The current distribution of sustainability projects in the Philippines highlights a strong focus in developing the infrastructure of regions in and adjacent to Metro Manila. Regionâ€™s III, IV-A and the National Capital Region are driven by massive infrastructure projects such as the North-South Commuter Railway, Bulacan International Airport and the Subic-Clark-Manila-Batangas Dedicated Rail Corridor.
                    These investments greatly improve public transportation and traffic congestion, and the prioritization of areas around Metro Manila can be attributed to its high population density and its role in the Philippine economy.

                    Additionally, the predominance of physical connectivity projects which account for 87.20% of the budget shows the priority of the Philippine
                    government in enchancing transportation services. These transporation projects also come from highly populated areas like Region III, IV-A 
                    and NCR, reflecting the government's efforts to improve economic efficiency. However, the sheer amount of transportation infrastructure
                    overshadow other types of projects from Water Resources and Agriculture, which are essential services in our rural communities.

                    this centralized approach to development leaves the other regions in the dust. Regions outside of the vicinity of Metro Manila receive fewer sustainability projects which reveals issues such as unequal access, slower regional growth, and inadequate infrastructure that stems from a lack of funding in national development plans. Neglecting these areas is especially concerning, as they are more vulnerable to climate change, lack basic services such as water, food and housing, and struggle with limited access to transportation, healthcare and education, all contributing to the widening gap in these communities as compared to the capital.

                    To reiterate, the goal of SGD 11 is to "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable". Fulfilling this vision is giving each region a chance to improve their cities with national projects that solve their unique challenges.
