                        SDG 11 goal is to "Make Cities and Human Settlements Inclusive, Safe, Resilient, and Sustainable". According to the United Nations, this SDG tackles problems related to transport, housing, and sustainable development such as Disaster Risk Reduction, accessibility, and minimization of environmental impact.

                    <p>
                        Key performance indicators are used to quantify the SDG and according to the SDG watch released by the Philippine Statistics Authority, the Philippines is far from reaching the desired goals for 2023. These indicators include:

                        The Philippines has launched numerous projects and initiatives that align with the goals of SDG 11. Through national planning, projects are led by agencies like the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) which aim to improve transportation, housing, disaster risk reduction, and access to basic services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some notable projects in the different areas of development are:
                    </p>

                    <p class="font-medium text-yellow-400 text-lg">1. Housing: New Clark City Affordable Housing</p>
                    <img src={newclark} alt="new clark city" class="w-full max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-4"/>
                    <p>The Bases Conversion and Development Authority plans to collaborate with South Korean companies such as Saekyung Realty Corporation and Overseas Infrastructure and Urban Development Corporation as well as local companies like Sta. Clara International Corporation.</p>
                    <p>The goal of this project is to create affordable housing in New Clark City, complemented with infrastructure that aligns with SGD 11 such as green spaces, transportation networks and disaster resiliient infrastructure.</p>

                    <p class="font-medium text-yellow-400 text-lg">2. Disaster Risk Reduction integrated disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation: Pampanga Bay</p>
                    <img src={pampanga} alt="pampanga" class="w-full max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-4"/>
                    <p>Pampanga experiences severe flooding due to a combination of geographical and climate conditions. First the area is regularly hit by monsoons and typhoons which bring heavy rainfall. Second, Pampanga is situated on an alluvial plain which makes it prone to flooding because of the limited space for rainwater and river networks to spread out. </p>
                    <p>The Integrated Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation (IDRR-CCA) Measures in Low Lying Areas of Pampanga Bay is implemented by the DPWH with funding from the Korean Economic Development and Cooperation Fund (KEDCF), This project aims to solve the flooding problem in Pampanga by improving the flooding infrastructure such as the drainage system.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-100 text-lg">
                    While these initiatives demonstrate how the projects of the Philippines align with the goals of SDG 11, they also expose a pattern: these projects are mostly centered around Metro Manila. The lack of regional focus begs the question â€“ are other communities being left behind in terms of national planning and infrastructure development?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-gray-100 text-lg">
                    This question has prompted the team to investigate the current projects of the Philippines. By doing this research, we will be able to find patterns about national investment as well as opportunities to pursue the SDG 11 with no community left behind.
